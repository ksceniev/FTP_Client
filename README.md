# FTP Client
a poor command line ftp_client just for my educational porposes then of course theres many many bugs yet.
i intend to make this script stronger just like the linux binary and write a ftp_server as well.
i used vsFTPd 3.0.3 for testig this script.

available commands:
- ls --> list the current directory
- cd --> change directory
- get --> download files from the server
